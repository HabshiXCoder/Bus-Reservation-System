# 🚌 Bus Reservation System  

A simple Java-based Bus Reservation System that allows users to register customers, add buses, search for available buses, reserve seats, cancel reservations, and manage a waiting list. The system also includes functionality to find the shortest route between cities using Dijkstra's algorithm.  

## 🚀 Features  
- Register customers with personal details  
- Add and manage bus details (routes, fare, seats, etc.)  
- Search for buses by code  
- Reserve seats and manage a waiting list  
- Cancel reservations and update available seats  
- Display and sort customers by age  
- Display and sort reservations by seat number  
- Find the shortest path between two cities using Dijkstra's algorithm  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Language**: Java  
- **Data Structures**: Linked Lists, Priority Queues, HashMaps  
- **Algorithm**: Dijkstra's Algorithm (Shortest Path)  
- **Input Handling**: Java Scanner
