# 🚌 Bus Reservation System  

A simple Java-based Bus Reservation System that allows users to register customers, add buses, search for available buses, reserve seats, cancel reservations, and manage a waiting list. The system also includes functionality to find the shortest route between cities using Dijkstra's algorithm.  

## 🚀 Features  
- Register customers with personal details  
- Add and manage bus details (routes, fare, seats, etc.)  
- Search for buses by code  
- Reserve seats and manage a waiting list  
- Cancel reservations and update available seats  
- Display and sort customers by age  
- Display and sort reservations by seat number  
- Find the shortest path between two cities using Dijkstra's algorithm  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Language**: Java  
- **Data Structures**: Linked Lists, Priority Queues, HashMaps  
- **Algorithm**: Dijkstra's Algorithm (Shortest Path)  
- **Input Handling**: Java Scanner  

## 📂 Files  
- `BusReservationSystem2.java` – Core system logic and data management  
- `Main.java` – Console-based UI and menu-driven interactions  

# 📝 User Manual for Bus Reservation System

## 📌 Introduction
This manual provides step-by-step instructions on how to use the Bus Reservation System. The system allows users to register customers, add buses, make reservations, cancel reservations, and find the shortest route between cities.

## 🛠 System Requirements
- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later**
- **NetBeans IDE (Apache NetBeans)**

## 📥 Installation Steps
1. **Download the ZIP file** from the repository.
2. **Extract the ZIP file** to your preferred location.
3. **Open NetBeans (Apache NetBeans)** and select **Open Project**.
4. Navigate to the extracted folder and open the project.
5. **Run the file** by selecting `Main.java` and clicking **Run**.

## 🎮 How to Use

Once the program starts, a menu will appear with multiple options:

1️⃣ **Initialize System**
   - Initializes the system and clears any existing data.

2️⃣ **Register a Customer**
   - Enter customer details (name, mobile number, email, city, and age) to register a new customer.

3️⃣ **Display Customers**
   - Lists all registered customers.

4️⃣ **Sort Customers by Age**
   - Sorts and displays customers based on their age.

5️⃣ **Register a Bus**
   - Adds a new bus by entering bus details (bus number, total seats, start and end locations, time, and fare).

6️⃣ **Search for a Bus**
   - Searches for a bus using its bus code and displays its details.

7️⃣ **Reserve a Seat**
   - Reserves a seat for a registered customer. If no seats are available, the customer is moved to the waiting list.

8️⃣ **Sort Reservations by Seat Number**
   - Sorts and displays reservations based on seat numbers.

9️⃣ **Display Reservations**
   - Shows a list of all seat reservations.

🔟 **Cancel a Reservation**
   - Cancels a reservation based on the customer's mobile number and updates seat availability.

1️⃣1️⃣ **Find Shortest Path Between Cities**
   - Dijkstra’s algorithm finds the shortest travel route between two cities based on available bus routes.

0️⃣ **Exit**
   - Exits the program.

## 🛠 Troubleshooting
- **NetBeans not detecting the project?** Ensure that you have extracted the ZIP file properly and opened the correct folder.
- **Errors while running?** Check if JDK is correctly installed and set up in NetBeans.
